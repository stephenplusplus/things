## things

If you want to have some control over your JavaScript, give `things` a shot!

The idea is, modularize your code. Not just file dependencies, but function/array/string/THINGS! as well.

This is a very rough draft of what is just a hobby project. There is a lot of room for improvement, so feel free to suggest features that are missing, or contribute some of your ideas!

For a nice walk-through of a pointless sample application, check out [this lovely breakdown](http://stephenplusplus.github.com/things)!
