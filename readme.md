#### 'tis this `things` thing?
---
If you want to fire up a quick app, `things` is your buddy. It forces you to write your app in a way that will allow it to grow. Even if it outgrows `things` itself.

The basic idea is: __plan your app__! Discover its dependencies. Not just file and library dependencies, but functions, objects, arrays, strings... THINGS! Tell `things` about them, and later when you need them, we'll hand them to you.
